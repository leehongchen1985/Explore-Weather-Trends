# Explore-Weather-Trends

## Objective

The objective of this project is analysing local (Singapore) and global temperature data. A comparison will be done for the two data trends of Singapore and global temperature data.

## Installation

The following tools/software are needed for this study:

- [excel](https://products.office.com/en-sg/excel)
- [python (with Pandas and Matplotlib )](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

##	Scope/Steps involved in the Study

The scope of this report focuses on the two datasets which are Singapore and global temperature data. The followings are steps involved in this project:

1.	Data extraction from temperature database by using SQL
2.	Accessing and analysing data in csv file by using Excel
3.	Plotting time series plot (line chart) by Python – Pandas, Matplotlib
4.	Data observation

## Plotting time series plot (line chart) by Python – Pandas, Matplotlib

After installing pycharm and python (with Pandas and Matplotlib, you could plot the time series by using python script saved at "pycharm_plotting_time_series.zip"

## Observation

This study focus on the observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
